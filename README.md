## Part 1: Data Processing and EDA
1. Load in the downloaded dataset into a DataFrame
2. Ensure all columns have appropriate data types
3. Identify rows with null or invalid value and deal with the rows appropriately
4. Create 2-4 interesting graphs that look at non coordinate attributes of the dataset
5. Create a map that uses coordinates to display the start and end coordinates of every trip
## Part 2: Linear Regression
1. Use a linear regression model to predict length of trip from distance of the trip
2. Visualize and explain the results of the model as well
## Part 3: Binary Classification
1. Create a model that will predict whether a trip will be on time or delayed.
  - You can use any features or model to accomplish this
2. Visualize and explain the results of the model
3. In a markdown cell, explain how the model could be improved
